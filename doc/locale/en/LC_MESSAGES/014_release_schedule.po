"The main difference between standard and LTS version lies in the support "

"supported LTS version meets all your requirements and you work on "
"projects that last for longer than the standard supported period.   "
"Preview versions provides a glimpse of upcoming features of new version "
"of FCS and provide a chance to provide feedback to the developers. It is "
"where we release non-critical bug fixes and are subject to constant "
"changes and no support is guaranteed, you should never use the preview "
"version without making backup of the data. You should only use the "
"preview if and only if you some specific features and you understand the "
"risk."

"FCS Sessions are forward compatible unless explicit noted otherwise, "
"however backward compatibility is not always guaranteed especially across"
" major version (e.g., 24.07, 24.10). That means, you can open FCS "
"sessions created in a previous version of FCS with newer versions of FCS."
" However, once opened in a newer version, you might not be able to open "
"the session in an older version of FCS anymore. Hence it is critical for "
"you to backup your files before moving to a newer version of FCS.  We try"
" to keep session backward compatible as much as possible within a major "
"version (e.g., across 24.07.01~24.07.10) however there is no guarantee.  "
"In case of using the same FCS session with others, it is critical for you"
" to ensure that your team use the same minor version of FCS."
