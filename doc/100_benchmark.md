# Benchmark




### Purpose
This page provides a showcase on the subject of improving the final animation quality by adding profiles from the video that you are processing. 
In the scenario that the output animation does not look as desire, one way to improve the animation quality is to add profiles from within the video itself. 


### Scenario Detail
In this show case, 
We selected 50 profiles from a base video as a baseline.
